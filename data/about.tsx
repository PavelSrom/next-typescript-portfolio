			I'm Pavel Srom, a MERN-stack web developer currently studying at CPH Business in
      Copenhagen, Denmark. As you can see from the counter above, I have been doing web
			development for quite some time. My passion for creating web solutions led me
    	to learn a ton of exciting technologies in a relatively short amount of time,
      and I'm still hungry for more.

			Apart from web development, I enjoy an intensive workout session, Czech candy,

				private school. I temporarily moved with my mom, hated
				everything at first, struggled a lot, but over time, I started
				getting used to it and was doing very well. As it turned out
				later, this was perhaps the defining experience for my future

				decided this is what I want to do for living, and I've been
				giving it my 100% ever since.`,

				empty folder to a fully functional product.`,

				the future are making native apps, serverless architecture, and
				maybe AI at some point.`,
